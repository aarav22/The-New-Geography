        "The New Geography app aims to make users aware of the various restrictions put on the internet, in this case, Maps. This project is made under the theme of Control in The New Geography course, offered by Professor Debayan Gupta, Ashoka University.

The app has sections such as ‘China’, ‘South Korea’, ‘Others’ and, ‘Bonus’. The sections represent various restrictions that have been put on Google Maps, where they do not allow certain places to be seen/accessible on the Maps.

In ‘China’, there are two options, you can choose to know about the problem(restriction), which leads you to the map of China, where Tienanmen Square is already loaded on the maps. Now, you’ll see a red marker on the location, but if you long press on the map, you can enable the satellite view and observe that the location in fact isn’t there. The reason as to why this happens is because the Chinese Government mandates everyone to use its own geodetic datum GCJ-02 instead of the standard WGS-84. See the documentation for more detail.

In the solution, a conversion between the two datums has been implemented from the leaked code, multiple sources have been used to uncover the final code and then used to find the exact point on Google Maps. Again, please do refer to the documentation for the code.

For other sections, you’ll find the necessary information in the respective sections."

    "In South Korea, the government has restricted Google from mapping its country as they couldn’t strike a deal where the government had requested Google to show some restricted locations in low resolution. And now, as you can see in ‘What’s the problem’ section, the map for the country is static and doesn’t offer navigation capabilities.

    A few of the other reasons for the restrictions are due to the Spatial Data Industry Promotion Act and the Promotion of Military Bases and Installations Act, which bar the export of map data outside the country. And having North Korea as neighbour certainly doesn’t help either.

    One solution to this is to opt for ingeniously developed apps such as Naver and Kakao. The laws though have in fact given local companies to keep Google and Apple out of the market."

        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

        "Assuming you have already seen what the problem is, there are several types of restrictions"
        "put on google maps other than the first two, which are more on the country level."
        "These restrictions are limited to particular regions and sites. \n\n"
        "The different kind of restrictions are:\n"

        "1. Large obscuring pixelation of the whole site\n"
        "2. Reduced resolution on most of the images.\n"
        "3. Blurred in Google Maps.\n"
        "4. Pixelation of military sites.\n"
        "5. The blurring of particular locations on the Google Street View.\n"
        "6. The blurring of entire islands(Amchitka Island) \n\n"
        "As a solution, well there are none other than physically visiting these places but this"
        "exactly where we see the downside of these restrictions! The Barbara Streisand effect where"
        "an attempt to hide, remove, or censor information has the unintended consequence of further"
        "publicizing that information, often via the Internet.\n\n"

        "So this is..exactly that. If you go on the Wikipedia page for restricted locations on"
        "google maps, you’ll find an entire compilation within each continent! So there’s a thought"
        "that had the sites not been restricted, maybe these sites wouldn’t have gotten so much attention."
